# Trail of Bits Audit
This repository is dedicated to hosting GitHub issues posted by the Trail of Bits audit team during the Maple LoanV2 audit, taking place in November 2021. Throughout the course of the audit, as the Trail of Bits team discovers issues, has suggestions, or has questions, they are encouraged to post to the GitHub issues in this repository. This will allow for a high degree of visibility and transparency between the two teams, as well as an increased capability to work asyncronously.

Below is a list of all labels that are available for use for issues (can also be found [here](https://github.com/maple-labs/trail-of-bits-audit/labels)).

For every issue that is posted to this repository, the Maple team asks that three labels are used:
* `Type`: Bug, Optimization, Question, Suggestion
* `Status`: Always set to `Ready for Review`, from there the Maple team will update the `Status` labels
* `Severity`: Low, Medium, High, Critical, this allows the Maple team to prioritize issues easily

Once a issue has been thoroughly discussed and addressed, the Maple team will update the `Status` label to one of the following:
* `Status: Dismissed`: Issue was acknowledged, and it was decided that the team will not make the requested changes
* `Status: Resolved`: Issue was acknowledged, and will be closed (used more for questions/suggestions)
* `Status: Fixed`: Issue was acknowledged, and a fix has been made
